# Old Romanian cartographic styles for QGIS

## Introduction about maps

In this repository we are sharing styles, symbols and colours that, when used together, can recreate the overall appearance of the first Romanian topographic maps made by the Military Geographical Institute.
The map sheets initially suffered from a lack of artistic unity, but the Institute later established a general set of rules for standardizing its cartographic products.  
The resulted maps are undoubtedly one of the most impressive works ever made by the Cartography School at the Geographical Institute.

## Symbols and styles

|Symbol| Numerical scale| File type |  Example  
| ---- | --------- |--------|------|
| Point| - | svg |  *forester's house, church, fountain, bridge* |
| Line| *1:25000* | qml | *river, contour line, road, railroad* |
| Polygon|*1:25000, 1:50000*| qml | *lake, vineyard, forest, pasture* |

In *[this folder](https://github.com/Cezar92/ro-cartostyles/tree/master/symbols%20and%20styles)* you will find a set of essential map symbols, polygon styles, and links to other useful map symbol resources.

## Colours

In *[this folder](https://github.com/Cezar92/ro-cartostyles/tree/master/colours)* you will find the colour information used to create the symbology, and links to other useful colour resources.

Sample of a 1:50000 scale map:

##  How to use it?  
You can use the .qml and .svg files to symbolize your data in the first Romanian topographic map style. Follow the [instructions in the .pdf file](https://github.com/Cezar92/ro-cartostyles/blob/master/iga_instructions.pdf) to find out how to apply them to your data in QGIS.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback about the styles then please raise an issue on this repository.

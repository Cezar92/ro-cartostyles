# Old Romanian cartographic styles for QGIS

## 1. Introduction about maps 

In this repository we are sharing styles and symbols.

## 2. Symbol types

 |Symbol| Numerical scale|   |  Example  
| ---- | --------- |--------|------|
| Point| - | svg |  *forester's house, church, fountain, bridge*
| Line| *1:25000* | qml| *river, contour line, road, railroad*
| Polygon|*1:25000, 1:50000*| qml| *lake, vineyard, forest, pasture* 

## 3. Map samples by scale:  
Sample of a 1:25000 scale map:
![1:25000](https://github.com/Cezar92/ro-cartostyles/blob/master/samples/ro_cartostyle_25k.png)  
Sample of a 1:50000 scale map:
![1:50000](https://github.com/Cezar92/ro-cartostyles/blob/master/samples/ro_cartostyle_50k.png)

## 4. How to use it?  
You can use the .qml and the .svg files to symbolize your data in the first romanian topographic style. Follow the instructions in the .pdf file to find out how to apply them to your QGIS projects.
